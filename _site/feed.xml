One of the major service[1] a central trusted third party provides is to verify identities when one wants to transact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take the example of Venmo. Venmo is a central trusted third-party. If Laura sends money to Raymond through the Venmo application. Venmo handles the identification and authentication (phone number + password, email + password or Touch ID, etc.). Venmo validates the identities of Laura (to send the money) and Raymond (to receive the money).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto&quot;&gt;Nakamoto&lt;/a&gt;’s quest to build an eletronic peer-to-peer cash system, he hoped to avoid by-pass a trusted third-party.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a trusted third-party, we are be forced to trust no-one. We still want to transact though. So here is the trick: we make all the transactions available to everyone: completely public. Anyone interested in looking at the electronic transactions can look at them, copy them. Everyone knows who’s buying from who (transacting). Think about publishing the list of transactions on a website available to anyone with an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, we have a list of transactions (electronic cash) with Raymond’s name on it (because he is the last owner). Raymond is the owner of the electronic cash. It has value to Raymond. It probably has value to someone else too. The main problem is: what stops Raymond’s nemesis (Abraham), from copying that list of transactions, adding another transaction at the end of the list that claims that he is the new owner? If Abraham does this, and publishes back on the internet, at this point Abraham would have stolen the electronic cash from Raymond! No one would want to use a cash system that could so easily be robbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Public key cryptography is a sub-field of cryptography that provides a solution to this problem. It provides a mathematical mechanism to validate that the transaction was aggreed upon with no way for Abraham to fake a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we are concretely trying to do is verify that a transaction (Laurie sends money to Raymond) was allowed by Laurie, and provide the assurance that Laurie can’t deny that she allowed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mathematics behind digital signature is pretty complex and there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEBfamv-_do&quot;&gt;great resources&lt;/a&gt; that get in the details of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurie needs to create a public key and a private key. The public key is what identifies Laurie, and what is provided in order to receive a transaction. (Laurie doesn’t actually give her name –it’s also useful for anonimity[3]–). The private key is something that you keep very secure and you don’t share with everyone. Treat even more carefully than a password, because you can’t change it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurie has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public key&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Private key&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Public key of Raymond (who’s suppose to receive the electronic cash)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laurie uses a mathematical method to generate a string of characters based on all of these information: it’s called “signing”, and it generates the what’s called the signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone in the network has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Laurie’s public key.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Raymond’s public key (the new owner).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The signature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an easy way (mathematical method) to look at the signature and confirm that it was actually signed by Laurie, and no-one else. This also assures that Laurie signed it. She can’t claim she didn’t do it because only someone with Laurie’s private key could have generated that signature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you like to think in analogies, here is how you need to think about it: the signature is a wax seal on an envelope. Anyone can open the envelope and look at the content, but the presence of the seal proves that the content was added in the envelope by the sender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what we used to have trusted third parties to help us ensure the identities of everyone involved in a transaction. We applied cryptography to ensure identities wihtout the need of third-parties.
Third-parties also provide a solution against ‘double spending’ which is important to solve to have usable electronic cash system. Interestingly enough, cryptography also provides a solution to the ‘double spending’ problem. We will cover it next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1] Double spending is another really important benefit that I’ll discuss in a future post.&lt;br /&gt;
[2] Removing a trusted third-party is important and fascinating for a lot of reason that I won’t discuss in this piece. Bear with me: just assume that it is for the better, at least for the sake of this discussion.&lt;br /&gt;
[3] Anonmininty is another property of cash tha tis pretty cool and that I will eventually discuss.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">In order to build a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, we can’t rely on a central trusted third party (It wouldn’t really be peer-to-peer otherwise).

  &lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to explain or define bitcoin in this piece. I &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;like to study in small concrete pieces&lt;/a&gt; of a bigger concept in order to understand the whole picture. In this article I’m diving into the electronic peer-to-peer transaction piece of bitcoin. It’s missing important and innovative parts. If one doesn’t truly understand the peer-to-peer transaction piece, the whole picture will always look off. No matter how much time you spend on the innovative part of bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at how a person-to-person transaction works in the real world. There is cash. Someone has that cash in their possession. They can decide to hand it over to someone else for exchange of goods or services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put in the most simple way, there are three properties:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The cash has a perceived value shared by both parties. (let’s not worry about the notion of value for the purpose of this discussion)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Someone can prove it owns the cash, by the sole fact that the cash is in their possession. (Let’s not worry about stolen cash, or counterfeit)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is an easy way to transfer the cash to someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to accomplish this in the electronic world, Satoshi Nakamoto has a few tricks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Picture a list of transactions digitally recorded. Every transaction references the previous one (it’s a chain of transactions). A transaction contains information about to the owner (the recipient of the transaction), a reference to the previous transaction (that’s the link in the chain), and the proof that the previous owner has aggreed to do the transaction. When a new transaction is added, it references back to the previous transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That chain of transactions is an eletronic coin.&lt;/strong&gt; Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because people perceive there is value in being the current (last) owner. [1]&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Someone can ‘prove’ that he is the owner of the electronic coin. (we will briefly discuss how the proof is provided later).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a mechanism to transfer that electronic coin to someone else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The leap of faith of believing that the chain of transactions is actual electronic cash is the hardest part. It feels fake, intangible, but at the end of the day, what makes you think that a piece of paper with “in god we trust” printed on it is actually cash? Because people around you also assign value to it.[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept is the same for electronic cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satoshi wants us to use cryptogaphy to ‘prove’ ownership. An owner signs the transaction and adds the signature to a transaction when transfering ownership. In very short, “signing” is a mathematical method to create a list of characters that demonstrate the authenticity of any digital message or document; in our case the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how a transaction works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Owner #1 is the current owner of the electronic coin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Owner #1 decides to transact and transfer the electronic coin to owner #2.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Owner #1 gets a public identifier of owner #2, a reference to the previous transaction (that describes how he became the current owner), and its own digital signature.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new transaction is created with all of that information.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Owner #2 can verify that the signature is correct and is now the owner of the electronic coin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a malicious person claimed to be the owner of the coin, let’s call him owner X. And he tries to transact, then owner #2 can look at the signatures in the chain of transactions and see if it all looks proper. If Owner X created the coin out of thin air, somewhere in the chain the signature will not match its respective owner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this method we can now prove ownership of electronic coin, transfer this coin. And no-one can fake ownership of the electronic coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious major problem that Satoshi needs to address is the fact that the owner of the electronic coin can send multiple time the same electronic coin without being caught. That’s called “double spending”, and that’s the main reason why banks play a role in our current system. Satoshi has a solution for this, and I’ll cover this later, once I spend more time discussing the digital signature process in more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thought experiment&lt;/em&gt;:
Without getting too utopian about the application of Satoshi’s idea, but to give you sense of how powerful the concept is, try to change the words “electronic coin” with “digital asset” in this essay. Electronic coin limits the imagination to the cash metaphore, but digital asset can take us in a lot of different places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
