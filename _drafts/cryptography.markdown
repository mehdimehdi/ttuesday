Cryptography

Humans are born with a very unique skill: consistently identify and authenticate someone that's in front of them. If you meet a good friend in person, you will recognize them instantly out of a crowd of people. The likelyhood that you won't be able to identify them is low, and the chances that someone else is tricking you in thinking they are that person is even lower.

When you move that process of identifying and authenticating to a phone conversation, that becomes a harder. When this happens over the internet without a live audio & video conversation it's impossible.

This process of identifying and authenticating is especially crucial to moving money on the internet.

In order to be able to transact over the internet, the 2 parties need to be able to say who they are, and they need to be able prove that they actually are who they say the are.
In real life we usually use a driver license in order to do that: 1. Go to a bank teller, 2. Say who you are (by giving your name or account number, 3. Provide your ID to show to the teller that the picture matches. (identification + authentication).

Let's have person #1 send money to person #2. Person #1 says "I'm Person #1"
