Something fundamental is happening in the digital world, and I haven't been able to (1) form an opnion on it by speed reading articles, (2) investing a bit of money in it and (3) hoping for it to go away.

No one is going to do the hard work of hashing it out.

The only way I know how to learn, is to break down the concepts in concrete digestible pieces, and deeply understanding the principle behind them.

That's I'll be doing here.

I'll write about crypto assets / currencies until I form an educated opinion on why it is important (or not) and how it's going to impact our lives (or not).
