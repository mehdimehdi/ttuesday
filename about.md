Something fundamental is happening in the digital world, I tried to makes sense of it by 

 1. speed reading articles on the subject
 2. investing a small amount of money in it 
 3. hoping for it to go away.

I still can't form an educated opinion on it. No one is going to do the hard work of hashing it out.

The only way I know how to learn, is by breaking down the concepts in concrete digestible pieces. And deeply understanding the principle behind these concepts.

That's I'll be doing here: discussing everything about cryptoassets.

I'll write about cryptoassets, cryptocurrencies until I form an educated opinion on why it is important (or not) and how it's going to impact our lives (or not).
