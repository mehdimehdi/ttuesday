Bitcoin has been able to accomplish something that hadn't been done before: use the block-chain and proof-of-work to enable computers to run a database without trusting each other.
That's primarily being as currency, but the mere fact that these inovation haven been proven viable opens the door to many applications. I call this that ** bla bla bla ** effect.

Bitcoin is also an head-less, open-source initiative, which means that the original founder(s) sees more value in openining up the idea to being copied, duplicated, forked. There is a principle that is "saint" about it because it allows the idea and innovation (and not necerarily the execution tied to the founding moment) to become the best reality, the best execution and the best future. Also it's not copyrighted or patented.

These 2 facts allowed to create a halo effect of many projects relying on the block-chain, and inspired by the proof-of-work to get founded. They all focus on different properties. They all take initate in different ways. They all have different paths. A lot of them are not going to go anywhere, and some of them will thrive as long as they serve a clear purpose, solve a real problem.


Here is a framework I found useful to use to look at different crypto currencies:

* Hard fork vs soft fork
* Consensus type
* Hashing function used
* What's special (store data, money, debt, speed, security, governance, turing complete language)

Bitcoin being completely decentralized now there is is enough
