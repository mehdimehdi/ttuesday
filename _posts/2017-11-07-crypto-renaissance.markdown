Bitcoin has been able to accomplish something that hadn't been done before: build a distributed database that doesn't require any trust between the parties involved. There are 2 innovations which made this possible : the [blockchain](/2017/08/28/double-spending.html) and [proof-of-work](/2017/09/27/proof-of-work.html).
It's primarily being used as currency because Satoshi Nakamoto rightly found the problem of digital cash to be unsolved.

the Luther effect.

Bitcoin is a head-less project: Satoshi Nakamoto the founder(s) decided to stay anoninous and [withdraw himself](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/16/gavin-andresen-bitcoin_n_3093316.html) to give true meaning to the decentralization of the project. By not revealing himself, herself or themselves, they are not weighing in the direction bitcoin is taking after its creation. He believed in the governance mechanism (concensus) to take care of the job. It's also an open-source initiative: the original founder(s) saw more value in openining up the idea to being copied, duplicated, forked than stayed owned by one entity. Again, there is a pure principle: it allows the idea and innovation (and not necerarily the execution tied to the founding moment) to become the best reality, the best execution and its the best future.

This means that after the concept of bitcoin was proven, many sharp minds took the idea and tried to improve it based on their own opinions. It's Evolution for blockchain based currencies, which are also known now as crypto currencies.

The projects started with different priorities in mind, and different execution.

The way they got started: forks or altcoin.
A fork will preserve the distribution of the coins up until the time of the fork. Then it diverges.
A altcoin is started from scratch via mining or some other mechanism.

The Consensus type: Proof of work or proof of stake?
We have shown that bitcoin uses the proof of work to secure the ledger. Proof of work is not perfect, it's subject to the tragedy of the common, it forces the miner to sell their bitcoin fast to pay for energy bills. Not optimal for a mainstream digital currency. A new method for securing blockchain was designed the proof-of stake.

What do they try to optimize for?
Every design makes a statement on how it sees the world, and not everyone sees the world the same way. Not everyone is happy with the design decision Bitcoin found itself in. Bitcoin has to prioritize some features at the cost of others, because of the sheer volume of development to maintain and improve software bitoin needs to be requires trade off that can't make everyone happy. The one that are top of in 2017 are: scalability vs the purest form of decentralization.

All forks and altcoins have different paths. A lot of them are going to fail and some of them will thrive as long as they serve a clear purpose, solve a real problem, and differentiate themselves from others. There is a world were many succeed.

A life of its own:

The mere fact that these inovations have been proven viable to build a online currency opens the door to many applications. Knowingly or not, Satoshi Nakamoto invented a technology that proves itself to allow for pure decentralization and a powerful econonmic model which reward for participation.

We have had decentralization in the past but the economic model was not around to support it.

There are a lot of problems in the digital world are in need for similar solution. A lot services in the internet that are ran by a corporation suffer of one, it is controlled by that corporation. Capitalism has been the main the most optimal way to solve for this problem. Rewarding the corporation for solving the problem better than any other corporation has been the best way to respond to that market.

With the discovery of the powerful economic model, then solving the similar type of model in a decentralized way is now not only technically possible, but economically viable.
In short, the team from the ethereum project added computation capabilities to a new crypto-currency. This now not only creates a whole set of new altcoins or tokens, but concrete application that are run on the ethereum platform.
