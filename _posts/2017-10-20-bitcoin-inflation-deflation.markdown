Inflation and deflation are natural mechanisms for any currencies to [regulate the economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0) they are a part of.

Monetary inflation is the act of creating currency with the goal of: (1) matching the growth of the amount of goods that are exchanged in the economy, or (2) monetizing debts in amount that offset depression effects of debt reduction and austerity.

There is loose consensus about the fact that monetary inflation, is likely to result in price inflation: an increase of cost of goods and services.

Deflation is short for price deflation, which is the opposite of price inflation: decrease of cost of goods and services.

The number of Bitcoin in circulation is increasing until 2140, the money supply is inflating. That's monetary inflation. After 2140, the number of Bitcoin in circulation will be decreasing (people won't take proper care of their coins): the money supply will be decreasing.

Slight inflation is conventionally described as good. It drives investment and consumption which is good for the economy. With guaranted return on investment, people who own currencies will lend more to people who will create more wealth. Consumers actually buy more goods because it might be more expensive in the future.

Deflation is traditionnaly described as bad. When prices are going down, people are less willing to spend their money (if they can wait a bit for buying a good or service, they will get a better price).

When the amount of bitcoin in circulation will go down, we can assume that we will land in situation where the 

If ther is no monetary inflation for bitcoin what happens?

The short answer: we don't know. Most economists think that monetary inflation is key to regulate the economy for the reason described above. But there is a small school of thought called the Austrian economists who don't believe monetary inflation is neceserary, and tha it actually hurts the free market. The claim is that inflation is actually bad because it distorts prices: 1/ it confiscates people's wealth by ..., 2/ it's better for debtors than creditors, 3/ never actually efficiently added in the system because prices are not adjusted at the same pace. It's a very strict libertarian view of the world that assures that bitcoin is unbiased and a stronger currency for our free market.


What I think is happening is that we are trying to make bitcoin fit into a existing category of the world we know from the past, but Bitcoin will probably create its own category that won't respect the same law of economy that we know so far.
