The number of Bitcoin in circulation is increasing until 2140, the money supply is inflating. After 2140, the number of Bitcoin in circulation will be decreasing (people won't take proper care of their coins): the money supply will be deflating.

In a centralized system, the supply is controlled by a central bank. Money is created to attempt to match the growth of the amount of goods that are exchanged in the economy or for quantitative easing.

Slight inflation is conventionally described as good. It drives investment and consumption which is good for the economy. With guaranted ROI, people who own currency will lend more to people who will create more wealth. Consumers actually buy more goods because it might be more expensive in the future.

Deflation is traditionnaly described as bad. It describes drop of value of a currency.
